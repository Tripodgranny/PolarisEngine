/*
 * Launcher 
 * 
 * Launches the window, sets the game logic, and starts the engine.
 * 
 * A window is created and acts as a singleton which is referenced by openGL
 * and other management components of the game.
 * 
 * A game logic object should contain the logic of the game, and be instantiated
 * after the window is created.
 * 
 * Finally, the EngineManager should be instantiated and its start method should
 * be called. The EngineManager contains the game loop which calls the render method
 * contained within the game logic object. Then, calls the window update method to 
 * swap buffers and poll events.
