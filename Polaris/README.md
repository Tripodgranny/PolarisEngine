# PolarisEngine
 Game Engine Version 0.01

Polaris is the eclipse project folder.

RESOURCE FOLDERS:
The resources folder has model and shader resources.
All other folders are also resources, excluding the models and uvs folders.
This set up needs to be changed so that all resources are in 
the same folder.

You need to configure the build path to include the LWJGL 3 Jars.
